# Mod3-Python-Bank-and-Poll

Preamble:
 - Analysis scripts are in two separate folders (PyBank & PyPoll).  Each folder has a 'Resources' folder.
 - When the Python scripts are run, they will look for the original data in the Resources folder.
 - They will process the data and export a txt file to their own folder (either PyBank or PyPoll).
 - When running, please ensure that the Resources folder and datafile are in the proper locations.
